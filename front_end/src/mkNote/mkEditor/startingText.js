## The Three Musketeers
The Three Musketeers (French: Les Trois Mousquetaires) 
is a historical adventure novel written in 1844 by French author Alexandre Dumas. 
It is in the swashbuckler genre, which has heroic, chivalrous 
swordsmen who fight for justice.

Set between 1625 and 1628, it recounts the adventures of a young 
man named d'Artagnan (a character based on Charles de Batz-Castelmore
d'Artagnan) after he leaves home to travel to Paris, hoping to join the 
Musketeers of the Guard. Although d'Artagnan is not able to join this elite 
corps immediately, he is befriended by three of the most formidable musketeers
of the age – Athos, Porthos and Aramis, "the three inseparables" – and becomes
involved in affairs of state and at court.

The Three Musketeers is primarily a historical and adventure novel. 
However, Dumas frequently portrays various injustices, abuses, 
and absurdities of the Ancien Régime, giving the novel an additional 
political significance at the time of its publication, a time when the 
debate in France between republicans and monarchists was still fierce. 
The story was first serialised from March to July 1844, during the July Monarchy, 
four years before the French Revolution of 1848 violently established the Second Republic.

Dumas presents his novel as one of a series of recovered manuscripts, 
turning the origins of his romance into a little drama of its own. 
In the Preface, he tells of being inspired by a scene in Mémoires de 
Monsieur d'Artagnan (1700), a historical novel by Gatien de Courtilz de 
Sandras, printed by Pierre Rouge in Amsterdam, which Dumas discovered during
his research for his history of Louis XIV. According to Dumas, 
the incident where d'Artagnan tells of his first visit to M. de Tréville,
captain of the Musketeers, and how, in the antechamber, he encountered three
young Béarnese with the names Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, made such an impression
on him that he continued to investigate. That much is true – the rest is fiction:
He finally found the names of the three musketeers in a manuscript titled Mémoire
de M. le comte de la Fère, etc. Dumas “requested permission” to reprint the manuscript;
permission was granted:
